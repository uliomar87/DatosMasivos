//Basic Statistics

// First you have to open the library
import org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.{Matrix, Vectors}

// Library to use the correlation method
import org.apache.spark.ml.stat.Correlation

// Allows a row value to be accessed through generic ordinal access, as well as primitive access
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row

// Create the values of the array
val data = Seq(
   (4, Seq((0, 1.0), (3, -2.0))),
  Vectors.dense(4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0),
  Vectors.dense(6.0, 7.0, 0.0, 8.0),
  Vectors.sparse(4, Seq((0, 9.0), (3, 1.0)))
)


// The data is extracted and a dataframe is created with respect to the characteristics
val df = data.map(Tuple1.apply).toDF("features")

// The Pearson correlation matrix is created using the dataframe that we just created and we ask for the first values with head
val Row(coeff1: Matrix) = Correlation.corr(df, "features").head






// Result
println(s"Pearson correlation matrix:\n $coeff1")


// The Spearman correlation matrix is created using the dataframe that we just created and we ask for the first values with head
val Row(coeff2: Matrix) = Correlation.corr(df, "features", "spearman").head


// Print the result
println(s"Spearman correlation matrix:\n $coeff2")

//Hypothesis testing


// Library to apply methods to vectors
import org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.{Vector, Vectors}

// The chiSquare library is also used to perform the necessary calculations
import org.apache.spark.ml.stat.ChiSquareTest

// The following sequence of dense vectors is created
val data = Seq(
  (0.0, Vectors.dense(0.5, 10.0)),
  (0.0, Vectors.dense(1.5, 20.0)),
  (1.0, Vectors.dense(1.5, 30.0)),
  (0.0, Vectors.dense(3.5, 30.0)),
  (0.0, Vectors.dense(3.5, 40.0)),
  (1.0, Vectors.dense(3.5, 40.0))
)


// Creation of the dataframe from the previous set of vectors
val df = data.toDF("label", "features")


// The first values of the previously created dataframe are taken
val chi = ChiSquareTest.test(df, "features", "label").head


// Starting with the parts of the test, the values of p will be searched
println(s"pValues = ${chi.getAs[Vector](0)}")


// After the model's degrees of freedom will be searched
println(s"degreesOfFreedom ${chi.getSeq[Int](1).mkString("[", ",", "]")}")


// Finally certain values are extracted from a given vector all based on the chi square function
println(s"statistics ${chi.getAs[Vector](2)}")


//Summarizer

// Import of necessary libraries.
import spark.implicits._    
import Summarizer._

// create a set of vectors or sequence
val data = Seq(
  (Vectors.dense(2.0, 3.0, 5.0), 1.0),
  (Vectors.dense(4.0, 6.0, 7.0), 2.0)
)


// Creation of the dataframe from the vectors
val df = data.toDF("features", "weight")



// Use the summarizer library to obtain the mean and variance of some data in the requested dataframe
val (meanVal, varianceVal) = df.select(metrics("mean", "variance").summary($"features", $"weight").as("summary")).select("summary.mean", "summary.variance").as[(Vector, Vector)].first()


// The variables previously worked on are printed
println(s"with weight: mean = ${meanVal}, variance = ${varianceVal}")

// The process is repeated with 2 new variables
val (meanVal2, varianceVal2) = df.select(mean($"features"), variance($"features"))
  .as[(Vector, Vector)].first()



// Variable printing
println(s"without weight: mean = ${meanVal2}, sum = ${varianceVal2}")
